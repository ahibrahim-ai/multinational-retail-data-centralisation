# Multinational Retail Data Centralisation

## Overview

Welcome to the Multinational Retail Data Centralisation project! 
This project aims to centralise sales data for a multinational company, providing a single source of truth for all sales-related metrics. 
By consolidating disparate data sources into one accessible database, this system ensures that team members can easily retrieve and analyse up-to-date sales data, 
driving more informed, data-driven decision-making.

## Project Description

In today's data-driven business environment, having access to accurate and timely data is crucial. Our multinational company sells a variety of goods globally, but the current distribution of sales data across multiple sources hampers efficient analysis and decision-making. The Multinational Retail Data Centralisation project addresses this challenge by developing a robust system to store and manage sales data in a centralized database.

## Objectives

**Data Centralisation:** â€ Aggregate sales data from various sources into a single, centralized database.
Single Source of Truth: Establish the database as the definitive source for all sales metrics.
Accessibility: Ensure that team members can easily access and query the database for up-to-date sales data.
Scalability: Design the system to handle large volumes of data and accommodate future growth.
Features

Data Integration: Seamless integration of sales data from multiple sources.
Database Management: Efficient storage and management of sales data.
Data Querying: Powerful querying capabilities to retrieve real-time sales metrics.
Data Analytics: Support for advanced data analytics and reporting.
Technologies Used

Database Management System (DBMS): Centralized database for storing sales data.
ETL Tools: Extract, Transform, Load processes to integrate data from various sources.
SQL: Structured Query Language for querying the database.
Data Warehousing: Techniques for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Python/R: Programming languages for data manipulation and analysis.
Data Visualization: Tools for creating visual representations of sales metrics.
